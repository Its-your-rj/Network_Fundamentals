### Section 1: Networking Commands

**Description:** This section covers the basic commands required for networking analysis and troubleshooting. These commands are fundamental for understanding network behavior and debugging.

**Commands List:**
- `ipconfig`: Display IP configuration.
- `ping`: Test connectivity with a destination.
- `netstat`: View active connections (with types like `-a`, `-n`, etc.).
- `nslookup`: DNS query (types include forward and reverse lookup).
- `tracert`: Trace the route to a destination.
- `arp`: Manage the ARP table.
- `telnet`: Remote access to devices.
- `ssh`: Secure shell for remote access.
- `systeminfo`: Display system configuration details.
- `route`: Manage routing tables.
- `getmac`: Display MAC addresses.
- `dig`: Perform DNS lookups.

### Section 2: Packet Analysis using Wireshark

**Description:** Wireshark is used to capture and analyze network packets. This section explains how packets are analyzed and highlights differences between HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

**Steps for Analysis:**
1. Launch Wireshark and select the network interface.
2. Start packet capture and load the target URL.
3. Filter packets using keywords like `http` or `https`.
4. Analyze the packet details (source/destination IP, headers, and payload).

**Key Observations:**
- **HTTP Traffic:** Data is transmitted in plaintext, exposing sensitive information.
- **HTTPS Traffic:** Encrypted data ensures confidentiality and security, with encrypted payloads.

### Section 3: Socket Programming (Client-Server in C)

**Description:** Implement a basic client-server model using C socket programming to establish communication between devices.

**Code Structure:**
- **Server:** Listens for client requests and responds to them.
- **Client:** Sends requests and receives responses from the server.

[Include code snippets in the repository.]

### Section 4: Stop-and-Wait Protocol Implementation

**Description:** Implement the Stop-and-Wait protocol in C with acknowledgment handling in a noisy channel.

**Code Explanation:**
- Sender transmits one packet and waits for an acknowledgment.
- Receiver sends an acknowledgment or requests retransmission in case of errors.

### Section 5: IoT Device Configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer

**Description:** Configure IoT devices in Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate a smart home setup.

**Steps for Configuration:**
1. Place devices (e.g., lights, fans, doors, windows).
2. Connect them to a wireless router and an IoT server.
3. Configure the server (e.g., set IP to `192.168.0.10`).
4. Log in to the IoT portal from a client (laptop) and control devices.

**Figure Reference:** The configuration demonstrates IoT devices connected via a wireless router and controlled using a web portal.

### Section 6: VLAN Configuration

**Description:** Set up VLANs in Cisco Packet Tracer to segregate networks based on departments.

**Steps for VLAN Setup:**
1. Assign devices to specific VLANs (e.g., IT, HR, Finance).
2. Configure VLAN IDs on the switch.
3. Enable trunking for inter-VLAN communication using a router.

**Figure Reference:** The diagram shows multiple VLANs (e.g., IT, HR, Finance) configured across switches.

### Section 7: Subnetting

**Description:** Divide a network into smaller subnets using appropriate subnet masks.

**Steps for Subnetting:**
1. Calculate subnet IDs and ranges based on the given IP block.
2. Assign subnets to switches and devices.
3. Configure routers for inter-subnet communication.

**Figure Reference:** The diagram illustrates subnet configurations for three networks with respective IP ranges.

### Section 8: Dynamic Routing

**Description:** Configure dynamic routing in Cisco Packet Tracer to enable automatic route learning between routers.

**Steps for Configuration:**
1. Configure router interfaces with IP addresses.
2. Use dynamic routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF).
3. Test connectivity between different networks.

### Section 9: Image Transfer using Socket Programming

**Description:** Demonstrate how to transfer image files between a client and server using socket programming in C.

**Implementation Details:**
- The client sends an image file to the server.
- The server receives and saves the file.
